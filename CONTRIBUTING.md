# Contributing

Contributions are always welcome from anyone! When proposing a contribution, please observe the following guidelines and requirements (slightly adapted from [Awesome Semantic Web](https://github.com/semantalytics/awesome-semantic-web/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)'s contribution guidelines).

## Guidelines

* Add **one link per Pull Request**.
    * Make sure the PR title is in the format of `Add project-name`.
    * Write down the reason why the library is awesome.
* Add the new item **in this format**: `* [project-name](http://example.com/) - A short description ends with a period.`
    * Keep descriptions concise and **short**.
    * Descriptions should explain why the item is awesome, not just what it is.
    * End descriptions with a period.
* Add a section if needed.
    * Add the section description.
    * Add the section title to Table of Contents.
* Search previous Pull Requests or Issues before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
* Don't mention `imageomics` in the description as it's implied.
* Check your spelling and grammar.
* Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.

## Quality Standards

To be on this list, items should adhere to these quality standards:

* Generally useful, available (FAIR), and inspiring to the community.
* Actively maintained (even if that just means acknowledging open issues when they arise).
* Stable or at least progressing toward stable (as opposed to intentionally left at "research grade")
* Documented.
* Tests are preferred but not required.

## Reporting Issues

Please open an issue if you would like to discuss anything that could be improved or have suggestions for making the list a more valuable resource. We realize sometimes packages fall into abandonment or have breaking builds for extended periods of time, so if you see that, feel free to change its listing or remove it, but please open an issue or PR to let the maintainers know.

Thanks everyone!
