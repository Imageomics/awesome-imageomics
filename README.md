# Awesome Imageomics

Awesome tools, dataset, models, workflows, and papers for those practicing or endeavoring to practice or use imageomics.

This list aims to be part of the ecosystem of community-maintained compilations of _awesome_ things, aspiring to follow the original [awesome template](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome), even if it may not (for now or ever) follow the strict template and submission requirements laid out there (in part because they seem dated, and at least partly seem to represent idiosyncratic style preferences than actual necessities for interoperability).

Anyone is welcome to contribute, open a pull request.
